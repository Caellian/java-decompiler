## Description
Put your question here.

If there are several related questions, feel free to ask them together.
If you have multiple unrelated questions, put them into separate issues.

These types of issues are used to fill gaps in the documentation.
Please refrain from creating issues for questions like "why isn't this working?",
send those directly to my [email](mailto:tin.svagelj@live.com), I'll respond faster.
