# Java Decompiler

[![Build](https://github.com/Caellian/java-decompiler/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Caellian/java-decompiler/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Build%22)

A modern and very efficient Java decompiler.

## State of the project

It's in early phases of development.
Currently, it reads class files properly and generates sources based on information present in them;
still haven't started with decompilation, but the major pieces are now in place.

## JVM support status

Latest version is currently being written to support any semi-recent Java version.
At a later stage, I'd like to go through [specs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/) and allow targetting different versions better.
